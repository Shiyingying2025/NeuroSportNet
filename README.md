# ðŸ§  Deep Learning for Sports Injury Detection & Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository presents the **NeuroBiomechanical Deep Learning Framework** for **sports injury detection** and **performance analysis** using **medical imaging**, **EMG**, and **motion capture data**. Our approach integrates deep learning with **biomechanical control models**, **stochastic optimal control**, and **reinforcement learning** to provide interpretable, adaptive, and real-time analysis for sports medicine applications.

> ðŸ’¡ Bridging the gap between AI and neuromechanics for next-generation sports medicine.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Multi-modal Data Integration**  
  Combines MRI, ultrasound, EMG signals, and motion capture sequences for comprehensive analysis.

- **NeuroBiomechanical Control Model (NBCM)**  
  Learns adaptive motor strategies using real-time feedback and biomechanical constraints.

- **Injury Risk Detection**  
  Identifies musculoskeletal abnormalities using advanced classification and segmentation methods.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Enhances neuromuscular efficiency through reinforcement learning and adaptive training suggestions.

- **Adaptive NeuroBiomechanical Optimization (ANBO)**  
  Dynamically adjusts load distribution and movement strategies to minimize injury risk.
